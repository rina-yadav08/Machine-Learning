# Machine-Learning Project
### Project : Discrimination of reflected sound signals

The surface of an object reflects a sound signal. Recording the reflected signal provides a time signal.This time signal results from the convolution of the incident acoustic wave with the surface properties of the reflecting object. Knowing the incident acoustic signal one can conclude on the reflecting object by analyzing the reflected signal.
### Task in detail 
Use reflected time signals to conclude on the reflecting object. As the number of objects is limited in our experimental setup, solving the task means discriminating the time signals. Apply machine learning (ML) to the time signal. The measuring signals data is provided.
1) To create a GUI,
2) To read time signals from given Excel files, one time signal per row, starting column and signal length (number of scan points) adjustable,
3) To distinguish between two classes, namely “Object #1” and “Not Object #1”,
4) To use data labels given in the Excel file or to create new labels and complete the data files,
5) To create a quadratic time-frequency representation (QTFR) of the signal,
6) To create a binary classifier (discriminator) by applying machine learning using labeled data,
7) To use the binary classifier for discriminating new data,
8) To assess the classifier 
9) To discuss the results,
